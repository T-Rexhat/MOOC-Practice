# REVIEW
# Programming Foundatons with HTML,CSS,JavaScript from Duke
In week 1 & 2, they will teach you on how to use HTML & CSS. While, in week 3 & 4, they will teach you how to use JavaScript to manipulate pixels. I dont think this course is for beginner because they introduce too many programming language at the same time. In addition, the instructor is also introducing for-loop principles in javascript without teaching the basic foundation of javascript such as operations/booleans. However, the good things about this course is the programming assignments/projects are fun & interesting!!!
I will rate this course 6/10

# Python Classes Inheritance - U-Michigan
The course is pretty easy & straightforward. You will learn how to use classes, inhertiance, changing/renewing methods in a new class you made. 
The most memorable moments from this course
is implementing python classes to make a pokemon & wheel of fortune game.

I will rate this course 7/10

# Runestone Academy with Algorithm & Data Structure in Python
This course will teach you the basics of data structuer & algorithm commonly used in computer science
using python as the programming language. IMO, The course explaination for algorithm/data structures are bad and horrible. 
I completed the textbook until binary search trees & graph because the book explainations is getting bad/worse. Therefore, I discontinue the BST & graph part and use another MOOC resource to teach me

I will rate this course 5/10

# How to code - Simple & Complex
